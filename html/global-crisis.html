            <h2>4. Impact on Agriculture</h2>
            <p>The impact of water scarcity on agriculture is substantial, influencing food production, rural economies,
                and global food security. Agriculture heavily relies on water for irrigation, and inadequate water
                availability significantly affects crop yield and quality. Farmers often face challenges in securing
                enough water for their fields, leading to reduced agricultural output, crop failures, and economic
                hardships.<br><img src="k.jpg" alt="water on agri" style="float:right;width:400px">
            <p></p>
            Water scarcity and erratic rainfall patterns due to climate change disrupt planting schedules and crop
            growth. Farmers may opt for less water-intensive crops or reduce the area under cultivation, impacting their
            income and food supply. Additionally, inadequate access to water for irrigation affects the cultivation of
            high-value crops and hampers the diversification of agricultural practices.
            <br>
            <p></p>
            In regions facing water scarcity, farmers often resort to unsustainable measures like over-extraction of
            groundwater, exacerbating the depletion of aquifers. This overexploitation leads to long-term consequences,
            including land subsidence and the deterioration of soil quality.
            <br>
            <p></p>
            The impact of water scarcity on agriculture is not isolatedâ€”it ripples through the food supply chain,
            affecting prices, food availability, and food security. Addressing these challenges necessitates the
            adoption of water-efficient agricultural practices, investment in water-saving technologies, improved water
            resource management, and the promotion of drought-resistant crop varieties. Sustainable agricultural
            policies, community engagement, and innovative water conservation techniques are essential to mitigate the
            adverse effects of water scarcity on agriculture and ensure stable food production.</p>
